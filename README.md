# üßÆ Tkinter GUI Calculator

A simple **GUI-based calculator** built with Python‚Äôs **Tkinter library**.  
This project is designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to building desktop applications in Python.  
üëâ Repo: [GUI-Calculator](https://github.com/Toby-Xavier/GUI-Calculator)

## üí° Idea Behind the Project
The main idea is to take a basic calculator concept and implement it with a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.  

Many beginners start by making calculators in the **command line**, but this project goes a step further by teaching:
- How to design a clean **GUI layout** using Tkinter widgets (frames, labels, buttons).
- How to handle **user interactions** through button clicks.
- How to dynamically **update the display** using `StringVar`.
- The basics of **event-driven programming** in Python.

This calculator demonstrates how Python can be used not only for scripts and logic but also to create **interactive desktop applications**.

## ‚ú® Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: ‚ûï Addition, ‚ûñ Subtraction, ‚úñ Multiplication, ‚ûó Division.
- Clear (`C`) button to reset the expression.
- Decimal (`.`) support.
- Responsive design: buttons resize automatically when the window is resized.
- Error handling (shows `Error` when an invalid expression is entered).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (built-in Python GUI toolkit)

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add support for keyboard input (typing numbers/operators instead of only clicking buttons).
- Include advanced operations (square root, percentage, exponents).
- Dark mode / theme switcher.
- Better error handling and user feedback.
